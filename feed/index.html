<p>MedMen has requested a refund from the political action committee What A Country! after an<a href="https://cannabiswire.com/2018/06/27/why-are-cannabis-industry-leaders-donating-to-anti-immigration-candidates/"> article from <em>Cannabis Wire</em></a> revealed that the PAC, which was formed by Florida Congressman Carlos Curbelo in 2015 and was donating thousands to anti-immigration candidates, was funded almost exclusively by leaders in the cannabis industry. <a href="https://medmen.com/">MedMen</a> is one of the largest cannabis companies in the country, currently operating eighteen shops in California, Nevada, and New York.</p>
<p>MedMen donated $5,000 to What A Country!, also known as WACPAC, on March 20th of 2018 and told <em>Cannabis Wire</em> this week that the company had been unaware of the PAC’s purpose.</p>
<p>“Regarding the donation to What A Country! PAC by our CEO Adam Bierman, it should be noted that we asked the PAC for a refund of the donation on July 6,” Daniel Yi, MedMen’s Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations, wrote in an email to <em>Cannabis Wire </em>on July 19. “The PAC is led by Florida Congressman Carlos Curbelo. Mr. Curbelo is a strong champion of marijuana legalization, and we believed we were supporting a leadership PAC. We later learned that some candidates who were supported by the PAC held positions contrary to our values, and we respectfully asked Congressman Curbelo for a refund, to which he complied. We remain a supporter of Congressman Curbelo and his efforts to legalize marijuana.”</p>
<p>This email from Yi came on the heels of backlash from advocates responding to the <em>Cannabis Wire</em> article, which ran June 27. On July 18, <a href="https://massreccouncil.com/">the Massachusetts Recreational Consumer Council</a> (MRCC), a non-profit advocacy organization that supports the “safety and well-being” of cannabis users, <a href="https://massreccouncil.com/mrcc-withdraws-partnership-from-masscba-event/">decided to withdraw</a> its sponsorship of a job fair partially sponsored by MedMen, in protest of the company’s donation to What a Country! The July 25 event, called Equity and Opportunity: A Jobs Fair for a New Economy, which will also have a legal clinic focused on record sealing, is being held by the<a href="https://www.masscba.com/events/2018/7/25/equity-and-opportunity-a-jobs-fair-for-a-new-economy"> Massachusetts Cannabis Business Association</a>, a non-profit organization whose “mission is to be the convener, voice, and advocate for the Commonwealth’s cannabis business community.” </p>
<p><a href="https://massreccouncil.com/mrcc-withdraws-partnership-from-masscba-event/">In a statement from MRCC</a> regarding its decision to pull out of the event, the organization demanded that MedMen “…remove funding from anti-immigration efforts that separate families and harm individuals affected by the war on drugs.” (The dispensary Patriot Care is also attending the fair in search of new employees. Patriot Care donated $2,000 to WACPAC.)</p>
<p>In an email response to MRCC, MedMen’s Yi wrote that the group’s decision to pull out of the job fair was “…very regrettable and I am afraid you have been fed misinformation. The allegations you have heard are unequivocally and patently false.” In the email, Yi says MedMen was unaware that the PAC had supported anti-immigration candidates. </p>
<p>“What a Country! is a leadership PAC and some of the candidates the PAC has supported in the past had positions on immigration that do not align with MedMen’s values,” wrote Yi. “When we learned of that we immediately requested a refund of our contribution.” In his email to MRCC, Yi claims that <em>Cannabis Wire</em> did not reach out to MedMen for comment before publication of the article, “<a href="https://cannabiswire.com/2018/06/27/why-are-cannabis-industry-leaders-donating-to-anti-immigration-candidates/">Why Are Cannabis Industry Leaders Donating to Anti-Immigration Candidates?</a>” However, Yi gave a statement regarding the donation to <em>Cannabis Wire</em> on June 25th, which was included in the piece.</p>

(This newsletter is free for now, but will soon be available only to Cannabis Wire subscribers.) **</em></p>
<p>In an email to MRCC and other job fair sponsors that was obtained by <em>Cannabis Wire</em>, <a href="http://www.publicpolicylaw.com/jay-youmans.html">Jay Youmans</a>, a founding member of Massachusetts Cannabis Business Association, and a senior advisor to the commissioner of the state’s health department, said he believed that MedMen was unaware of the purpose of the What a Country! PAC, adding that it was unfortunate that Curbelo had used WACPAC funds to support candidates with anti-immigration views. In the email, Youmans writes that the purpose of the job fair was to connect people to more than 200 jobs as well as provide legal services. MRCC was a sponsor of the event, along with other advocacy organizations, dispensaries, and business leaders. “As an aside,” Youmans wrote in the email, “www.cannabuswire.com [sic] was created days before this piece was written and has largely only covered this one issue.”</p>
<p>WACPAC<a href="http://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/730/15031373730/15031373730.pdf"> was formed in January</a> of 2015, and Curbelo has publicly discussed the purpose of the PAC to multiple news outlets. Curbelo told <a href="http://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/2015/01/carlos-curbelo-creates-leadership-pac-to-benefit-pro-immigration-reform-republicans.html"><em>The Miami</em> <em>Herald</em></a> in 2015 that the mission of the PAC was to “…support candidates who understand the importance of overhauling our nation’s immigration laws to secure our borders, promote legal immigration, and reward those who contribute to our economy.”</p>
<p>Curbelo also discussed the purpose of the PAC<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/rep-curbelo-forms-pac-help-elect-gop-backers-immigration-reform-n296821"> in a statement to NBC News</a>: “I can assure you that there is a silent majority of House Republicans that believe that it is critical to overhaul our country’s immigration law from A to Z,” said Curbelo. “This is part of the effort to support them and to continue building momentum for this necessary reform.” </p>
<p>That Curbelo’s immigration PAC has donated to anti-immigration candidates was also made public prior to MedMen’s contribution, in a <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/election/article86212547.html">June 2016 article</a> from the <em>Herald</em>. WACPAC has been donating to immigration hard-liners since its formation in January 2015. </p>
<p>In response to MedMen’s email, MRCC’s co-founder Sonia Espinosa called on MedMen to provide a receipt of the refund from WACPAC. “Children are currently sitting in detention centers, this is not something we take lightly,” wrote Espinosa. <em>Cannabis Wire</em> obtained both MedMen’s email and Espinosa’s response. At press time, MedMen had not yet responded to Espinosa’s email. </p>
<p>“There’s two things I want to be careful about,” said Yi in an interview with <em>Cannabis Wire</em>. “We’re not a political entity. We’re a business. And we’re in the business of cannabis. And in the business of cannabis, obviously we have not just a business interest in cannabis reform, but as an industry and as people who work in this space, we want to support cannabis reform at every level.” Yi added that MedMen is dedicated to non-partisanship, and that the company is “constantly looking at our political donation process, and I think this was a learning experience for us.” Yi said the company has not yet received the refund from WACPAC, but that the organization has committed to refunding the money. <em>Cannabis Wire</em> contacted Curbelo to confirm this, but did not receive a reply by publication. </p>
<p>In the letter requesting a refund from WACPAC, MedMen’s Vice President of Government Affairs, Morgan Sokol, reiterated the company’s support for Curbelo. “Regrettably, it has come to our attention that WAC PAC’s efforts have supported candidates who do not align with our values, goals, and cannabis reform-minded mission.” Sokol adds that MedMen is looking forward to working with Curbelo on “policy issues of mutual concern.”</p>
<p>Additionally, CEO Adam Bierman has donated $5,400 to Curbelo’s re-election campaign. He also donated $1,000 to Republican Senator Rand Paul and $1,500 to the New York State Republican Campaign Committee. MedMen has also donated to Democratic candidates, including $10,400 to Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto and $10,800 to Pennsylvania State Senator Daylin Leach.</p>
<p>In an email to <em>Cannabis Wire</em>, Espinosa made note that MRCC had received $800 from the Massachusetts Cannabis Business Association for the jobs event before they knew MedMen would be involved. “We used this money to fund an event and we don’t plan on giving it back,” Espinosa said. </p>

<div id="">
<p>With 89 days to go until <a href="https://globalnews.ca/tag/marijuana-legalization/">legal recreational marijuana is a reality</a> on Oct. 17, it’s no longer clear how many <a href="https://globalnews.ca/tag/ontario-cannabis-store/">legal cannabis stores Ontario is planning to open</a>, or who will run them.</p>
<p>An FAQ published by the Ontario Cannabis Store (OCS) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180710100902/https://ocscannabisupdates.com/faq/">still says the agency plans to open 40 bricks-and-mortar stores</a> in 2018.</p>
<p>However, a spokesperson for the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, the OCS’s parent agency, would not say if it still planned to meet that target, writing that “updates on OCS retail openings will be provided in the near future.”</p>
<p>The OCS last made a public announcement <a href="https://ocscannabisupdates.com/update-ontario-cannabis-store-appoints-president-identifies-first-addresses-for-stores-issues-product-call-for-cannabis-and-accessories-appoints-two-new-board-members/">in early April</a>.</p>
<p>At that time, it named four addresses for retail stores, in Guelph, Kingston, Toronto and Thunder Bay, and announced that senior civil servant Nancy Kennedy had been named to lead the agency.</p>
<p>

		</p>
<p>However, Kennedy <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/news-secretary#2018-june-29-a">moved to a job in Ontario’s cabinet office</a> in late June. Former Alcohol and Gaming Commission official David Phillips is the OCS’s acting head, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-phillips-69b09b32/">according to his LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>
<p>The change in leadership was not publicly announced. <span class="gnca-article-story-txt gn-speakable-description">LCBO spokesperson <span class="st">Nicole Laoutaris</span></span> would not answer questions about the context of Kennedy’s departure, or plans for a permanent replacement.</p>
<p>Asked directly whether Ontario was still committed to the public-sector model that the previous Liberal government decided on, finance ministry spokesperson Scott Blodgett would say only that “the government has been working to launch a cannabis retail and distribution system to meet the federal legalization timeline of Oct. 17, 2018. Ontario will be ready with a system in place that meets the objectives of protecting youth and eliminating the illegal market.”</p>

		</p>
<p>Blodgett would not comment on <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/ontario-freezes-cannabis-store-leasing-possible-shift-sources-say/">a report in a cannabis industry newsletter on Thursday</a> that the OCS had stopped signing store leases.</p>
<p>The lack of much visible activity at the store sites until recently, coupled with a lack of communication, naturally raises questions about whether the PCs plan a change in direction away from the <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/2399412/lcbo-very-well-suited-to-sell-marijuana-premier-wynne/">government-run, union-staffed model</a> the Liberals chose and handed on to them.</p>

<p>“I don’t think there’s going to be a change in model,” says Warren (Smokey) Thomas, who heads Ontario’s government employees’ union.</p>
<p>The then-Liberal government and the Ontario Public Sector Employees Union agreed last year that <a href="https://opseu.org/news/we-did-it-deal-reached-better-lcbo-2017-lbed-bargaining-bulletin-19">cannabis store workers would be members of OPSEU</a>.</p>

<p>In March, during the provincial election campaign, Ford said he was open to <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/4082032/wynne-doug-ford-marijuana/">letting the private sector sell marijuana</a>.</p>

		</strong>
		</p>
<p>Asked about marijuana sales in June, Ford said that ” … what I said is I’d be focusing on the LCBO. I’m private sector. I don’t believe government should stick their nose into everything … .we’re going to make a decision after we talk to caucus. But I also said we’d keep it in the LCBOs because they have the structure already put together.”</p>
<p>Ontario cannabis laws passed last year give the Ontario Cannabis Retail Corporation a monopoly on sales, but also give the finance minister <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/17o26#BK2">broad authority to create exceptions.</a></p>
<p>Global News visited three of the publicly announced sites this week. Progress varied:</p>
<p>In <strong>Kingston</strong>, Global News reporter Alexandra Mazur found an empty store with papered windows and a ‘For Lease’ sign.</p>

<p>No building permits are displayed, and the inside is empty:</p>

<p>The <strong>Guelph </strong>store was silent and empty until late June, but is now an active work site with a fence around it, says Global editor Brian McKechnie.</p>
<p>The <strong>Toronto</strong> store attracted controversy this spring when it turned out to be <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/4141048/kathleen-wynne-cannabis-toronto-location/">about 400 metres from an elementary school</a>. (Minors won’t be allowed into cannabis stores, and someone will be posted at the entrance to check ID. Quebec will allow cannabis stores to be <a href="https://infocannabis.saq.com/en/the-societe-quebecoise-du-cannabis-confirms-its-first-montreal-store-and-continues-its-regional-development/">250 metres from schools, or 150 metres in Montreal</a>.)</p>
<p>In June, incoming Ontario Premier Doug Ford seemed to refer to the site when he said that “my priority is to make sure that we protect our children, we don’t make the mistakes of the previous Liberal government by putting a pot store right beside a school, which is absolutely ridiculous and it won’t happen under our administration.”</p>

<p>Like the Guelph site, the Toronto location was quiet until mid-June.</p>
<p>However, when Global News visited this week, active renovation work was happening, and four building permits were displayed that City of Toronto records show had been granted to OCS. Construction workers confirmed that the location was a future cannabis store. However, the building permits were only issued in mid-July.</p>

<p>Other provinces show signs of much more activity on the cannabis legalization file.</p>
<p><strong>New Brunswick</strong>, for example, will have <a href="http://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/news/news_release.2018.01.0105.html">20 government-operated stores open on Day 1</a>. On Thursday, <strong>Newfoundland and Labrador</strong> released a list of <a href="http://www.shopcannabisnl.com/request-for-proposals">29 private-sector cannabis store locations</a> that are being screened by the government. And <strong>Nova Scotia</strong>, where marijuana will be sold from some liquor stores, was showing off the arrangements in Halifax this week:</p>

<p>If you’re a smoker who enjoys puffing throughout the Halifax Regional Municipality, prepare for your smoking location to be heavily restricted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We’re changing completely the way you look at smokers in Halifax. Whereas currently, smokers walk down the street and they will smoke anywhere they want until they see a sign that says ‘no smoking’ and then they put their cigarettes out. What we’re going into is a situation where you can’t smoke unless you see a sign,” Brendan Elliott said, a senior communications advisor with Halifax.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This week, regional council voted 13-3 in favour of amendments to the nuisance bylaw that would significantly restrict smoking in public places throughout the municipality.</p>
<p>

		</strong>
		</p>
<p>The incoming changes mean smoking will only be allowed on municipal properties such as sidewalks, streets, parks and trails where there is a designated smoking sign.</p>
<p>Otherwise, smoking of any kind is prohibited.</p>
<p>“We know there’s going to be a demand for smoking cannabis and for smoking tobacco. There already is. So we’ll be looking for places, and we already are actively looking for places where we’ll have those designated smoking areas,” said Coun. Shawn Cleary.</p>
<p>The amendments came as a shock to some Halifax business community members.</p>
<p>“I thought it was sort of done very sneakily,” said Erik Greiner, bar manager at the Old Triangle Irish Alehouse in downtown Halifax. “There was no consultation. Nobody really had any warning about it and we still don’t really know when it’s taking effect.”</p>
<p>According to the city staff report that regional council voted on, there was “community engagement” regarding the proposed changes.</p>
<p>However, those engagements weren’t open to the public and didn’t include members of the business community.</p>
<p>Greiner says his main concern is over who will be responsible for enforcing the new changes.</p>
<p>“If we see patrons outside that are smoking, I want to know am I obliged to actually go out and say to them, to educate them on what the new bylaws are? Do I have to direct them to a smoking zone, [and] if I do, where is the smoking zone? And am I sending people who might have had a beer or two two blocks up the road to have a cigarette, and can I do that in safety?” Greiner said.</p>
<p>According to city officials, an extra eight bylaw enforcement officers are being hired to take on the new amendments.</p>
<p>Fines could be issued between $25-$2,000, but are being seen as a “last resort.”</p>
<p>

		</p>
<p>“It’s a lot easier to come in strict in the beginning and then loosen the reigns than to come in with something that’s not as strict and then make it stricter,” Elliott said. “We’re not out here trying to outlaw smoking, we just want to put sings where it makes sense.”</p>
<p>Greiner feels the decision is “heavy-handed” by the government, regardless of the fact that designated smoking spaces will be made available and that it will negatively impact not only local citizens but tourists as well.</p>
<p>“It’s going to impact tourism, it’s going to impact people who don’t know Halifax, who are visitors to our city and do I have to educate every single person who comes through the door?”Greiner wonders.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Welcome to Halifax, by the way, you can’t smoke here,”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently, over 1,000 signs are being produced to indicate where smoking will be allowed throughout the municipality.</p>
<p>The new law is expected to be rolled out a few weeks before marijuana legalization on October 17.</p>

<p>Having said in June that censoring an ad for a Montreal group’s panel discussion on marijuana was a mistake, Facebook then proceeded to censor it all over again in July.</p>
<p>And Facebook also censored an ad the group had bought that linked to a <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/4299714/facebook-censor-marijuana-panel/">Global News story on the original censorship</a>.</p>
<p>“I was a little flabbergasted by it,” says M<span class="gnca-article-story-txt gn-speakable-description">cGill University Ph.D. student Shawn McGuirk, one of the event’s organizers. </span></p>

		</strong></p>
<p>Here’s how things unfolded:</p>
<p>On <strong>June 26</strong>, <span class="gnca-article-story-txt gn-speakable-description">McGuirk tried to buy a Facebook ad promoting a panel discussion on marijuana legalization scheduled for July 9 organized by the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/spexchange/about/?ref=page_internal">Science and Policy Exchange</a>. It took him five hours to come up with an ad that Facebook would agree to publish — version after version was rejected for “promoting illegal drugs.” The final version, which was published, didn’t use the word “cannabis,” have a picture of a marijuana leaf or link to the original Facebook event. </span></p>
<p>On <strong>June 29</strong>, Global News <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/4299714/facebook-censor-marijuana-panel/">published a story</a> about the issue. A Facebook spokesperson said at the time that the platform had made a mistake:</p>
<p>“This ad does not violate our ad policies. We apologize for the error,” a spokesperson wrote. “We do allow marijuana advocacy content as long as it is not promoting the sale of the drug.”</p>
<p>That seemed to settle the matter. But on <strong>July 7</strong>, when McGuirk tried to promote the event again, his ad was once more rejected.</p>
<p>“The same message as before popped up, saying, ‘This ad is now rejected because it promotes illegal drugs,&#8217;” McGuirk says. “There was still a button to appeal, so I resent them the article that Global wrote that had the quote from somebody at Facebook in it, and they replied saying that their position hasn’t changed, that they still consider that this doesn’t follow their policies, and we should change our ad if we wanted to continue.”</p>
<p>Here’s what that exchange looked like:</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4339047" src="https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/communications-with-facebook-after-ad-1-re-rejected.jpg?quality=70&amp;strip=all&amp;strip=all" alt="" width="100%"/></p>
<p>On <strong>July 10</strong>, after the panel had come and gone, Facebook rejected an ad the group had bought — and which was initially approved — linking to Global’s story:</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4339051" src="https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/ad-2-disapproved-admin-view.png" alt="" width="100%"/></p>
<p>“The ad that we had promoted that was specifically with (Global’s) article after the ad ended and after the event itself ended,” McGuirk says. “Six hours after the event ended, they sent us a message saying they were disapproving the ad, even though it had already completed, which is kind of an odd thing to do.”</p>
<p>“This ad was mistakenly disapproved and we apologize for the error,” a Facebook spokesperson wrote in an e-mail. “We do allow marijuana advocacy content as long as it is not promoting the use or sale of the drug.”</p>

<p>“It was a last-minute event, which meant that it was really important to have people there,” explains board member Dessy Pavlova. “(The ad) was approved and disapproved maybe five times. We had a week ahead of the event to plan for it, so we didn’t manage to get it up at all.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I get that they’re trying to limit illegal behavior, but there has to be a way to differentiate education from selling drugs.”</p>

<p>Asked why marijuana-related ads were refused so consistently, if Facebook policy allows them, a spokesperson for the platform would not respond for the record.</p>

<p>Facebook’s restrictions also raise questions about how, or if, government cannabis retailers can use the platform.</p>
<p>Documents released to Global News under access-to-information laws show that Ontario’s cannabis retailer expects Facebook to restrict what it can do with a planned Facebook page.</p>
<p>“I reached out to our Facebook contact and he informed me that there will be issues with having product advertising on Facebook and Instagram, as it contravenes the Facebook usage policy (even though it will be decriminalized Facebook does not allow the promotion of drugs,” an LCBO official wrote in an e-mail in February.</p>
<p>The Liquor Control Board of Ontario refused to answer questions about the Ontario Cannabis Store’s social media presence.</p>
<p>(The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LCBO/">LCBO’s Facebook page</a>, which has 210,000 followers, is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LCBO/photos/a.550025451691802.139015.114203688607316/2261088227252174/?type=3">used extensively to promote</a> various forms of alcohol.)</p>

<p>New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo﻿ has received nearly $100,000 in donations from major national cannabis industry players despite his reluctance to support cannabis legalization. The donations so far have come from Columbia Care CEO Nicholas Vita and MedMen. Both companies hold coveted licenses to operate in New York (only ten have been issued).</p>
<p>Cuomo’s Democratic primary challenger Cynthia Nixon, who has been outspoken about <a href="https://cannabiswire.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=54cd15fa69101eaf2e8f1cf3a&amp;id=7441df5b86&amp;e=5083b8dcea">her support for recreational ﻿</a>use legalization and ending racial disparities in cannabis arrests, has not <a href="https://cannabiswire.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=54cd15fa69101eaf2e8f1cf3a&amp;id=76e9c073f1&amp;e=5083b8dcea">received</a> donations from any of New York’s licensed cannabis companies.</p>
<p>“Cynthia has pledged to accept no corporate donations,” Nixon campaign spokeswoman Lauren Hitt wrote in an email to <em>Cannabis Wire</em>. “She has been critical of how white wealthy men seem to be predominantly profiting from the legalization movement. She believes we need to ensure that communities of color, who for so long were disproportionately criminalized for marijuana use, reap the benefits.”</p>
<p><em>** To get original news and analysis like this from veteran journalists straight to your inbox every morning, sign up for Cannabis Wire’s <a href="https://cannabiswire.com/newsletter/">daily newsletter here</a>. (This newsletter is free for now, but will soon be available only to Cannabis Wire subscribers.) **</em></p>
<p>Nixon has yet to accept donations from any PACs or LLCs. Instead, she’s funding her fight for legalization the grassroots way: On April 11th, Nixon added an option on her <a href="https://cannabiswire.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=54cd15fa69101eaf2e8f1cf3a&amp;id=52352813a8&amp;e=5083b8dcea">ActBlue donation site</a> that allowed supporters to donate a recurring $4.20 per month. “A lot of people have been donating exactly $4.20 since we announced our plan to legalize weed in NY,” <a href="https://cannabiswire.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=54cd15fa69101eaf2e8f1cf3a&amp;id=47e584d2f2&amp;e=5083b8dcea">Nixon tweeted</a>. “Can we get 1,000 people to donate $4.20 a month in the next 24 hours? Let’s try.” Since that announcement, Nixon has received <a href="https://cannabiswire.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=54cd15fa69101eaf2e8f1cf3a&amp;id=3e1f84c36c&amp;e=5083b8dcea">1,631 donations</a> in this amount. </p>
<p>MedMen, one of the largest cannabis companies in the country, currently operates eighteen shops in California, Nevada, and New York. The company opened its flagship shop on Manhattan’s 5th Ave this year. MedMen’s political lobbying arm, MedMen Opportunity Fund II LLC has ﻿<a href="https://cannabiswire.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=54cd15fa69101eaf2e8f1cf3a&amp;id=b09244c1e3&amp;e=5083b8dcea">donated $65,000</a> to the Cuomo campaign so far. Last month, <a href="https://cannabiswire.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=54cd15fa69101eaf2e8f1cf3a&amp;id=848c95759f&amp;e=5083b8dcea">Cannabis Wire reported</a> that MedMen CEO Adam Bierman has also donated $5,000 to a PAC called What A Country! that donated to anti-immigration candidates. Bierman also donated $1,500 to the New York State Senate Republican Campaign Committee last May.</p>
<p>Nicholas Vita is the CEO of Columbia Care, a national cannabis company with a dispensary in Manhattan’s Union Square, among other locations, whose website claims it is “the nation’s largest and most experienced medical cannabis company.” Vita <a href="https://cannabiswire.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=54cd15fa69101eaf2e8f1cf3a&amp;id=94aa204188&amp;e=5083b8dcea">donated $25,000</a> to Cuomo’s re-election campaign in January of 2017.</p>
<p>Cuomo has yet to endorse the legalization of adult-use cannabis. In February 2017, Cuomo <a href="https://cannabiswire.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=54cd15fa69101eaf2e8f1cf3a&amp;id=94eeeca1d3&amp;e=5083b8dcea">referred to cannabis as a “gateway drug.</a>” In January 2018, Cuomo seemed to budge on his position when he <a href="https://cannabiswire.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=54cd15fa69101eaf2e8f1cf3a&amp;id=1d61658ded&amp;e=5083b8dcea">commissioned a study ﻿</a>about the benefits and drawbacks of statewide legalization, the <a href="https://cannabiswire.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=54cd15fa69101eaf2e8f1cf3a&amp;id=99524d4884&amp;e=5083b8dcea">results of which</a> were released last week. The commission concluded that the “positive effects of regulating an adult (21 and over) marijuana market in NYS outweigh the potential negative impacts,” and that “no insurmountable obstacles to regulation of marijuana were raised.”</p>
<p>Nixon has <a href="https://cannabiswire.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=54cd15fa69101eaf2e8f1cf3a&amp;id=a5a987c655&amp;e=5083b8dcea">tweeted</a> that Cuomo’s actions on cannabis represent #TheCynthiaEffect, or, in other words, that she is leading on the cannabis issue. None of Nixon’s individual donors have given anything over $21,000. In fact, only three people gave $21,000: Professor of medicine Cynthia Sears, artist Friedrike Merck, and actress Rosie O’Donnell.</p>
<p>Cuomo, MedMen Opportunity Fund II LLC, and Nicholas Vita could not be reached for comment by time of publication. This piece will be updated with any comments.</p>

<p>With marijuana legalization looming, municipalities are working hard to get the fine details ready.</p>
<p>West Vancouver, which has no medical marijuana shops currently, said it’s moving in the green direction.</p>
<p>Mayor Michael Smith said before October 17th, pot shops looking to open will need to go through a rezoning hearing.</p>
<p>“Technically apply to open one tomorrow, you would go through a process, staff would bring it to council with a recommendation and council may, or may not approve it.”</p>

<p>“We’ve been told by government forever that this is something that shouldn’t be, that you shouldn’t be able to acquire or use marijuana and now all of a sudden we’re doing a 180 and saying as of October it’s going to be legal.</p>
<p>He adds five or six shops have come forward seeking application.</p>

<p>TORONTO – Gerald Major goes out on the back balcony of his condo several times a day, leaning against the wall and smoking or vaping medicinal cannabis to ease the pain and other symptoms of severe arthritis.</p>
<p>But the looming legalization of recreational marijuana may put his daily ritual in jeopardy, as condominium corporations and apartment buildings across the country scramble to enact rules that would ban pot smoking inside units, on balconies and in common areas used by residents.</p>

<p>“I don’t use inside my dwelling, I have a seven-year-old. I don’t think it’s healthy, nor is it necessary,” said Major, 46, who has had eight surgeries in the last eight years related to ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis, which he began developing at age 14.</p>
<p>“So I discretely go about my business and try to respect everyone around,” he said. “The solution I have right now is fine because all the vape goes away from anyone and it’s not going in anyone’s windows.”</p>

<p>Major and his family moved into the Oakville, Ont., condo about five years ago, a couple of years after his medical condition forced him to give up his job running hedge-fund services for a major North American bank.</p>
<p>Although there’s been no such notice circulated to residents, Major is worried what he would do if his condo corporation and the building’s board of directors decide to outlaw pot smoking and vaping on the property in the run-up to Oct. 17, when toking recreational cannabis becomes legal.</p>
<p>“If it does go that way, then my board will certainly take the most conservative approach. And then, I guess I’ll be looking for another place to live.”</p>

<p>Toronto condo lawyer Denise Lash said her firm has been kept hopping by clients putting new rules in place for their buildings before cannabis is decriminalized, often resulting in some residents objecting to the changes. Social media has been rife with complaints about condo boards being high-handed in banning weed.</p>
<p>Lash said that over the past few years, many condo corporations were focused on dealing with tobacco use within units and in common areas of their properties.</p>
<p>“So now that we have marijuana that’s going to be legalized, there’s a real concern that there’s going to be more (pot) smokers,” she said, noting that the pungent fumes from a joint can permeate nearby condo units, which non-using residents could argue is not only a nuisance but also a health risk.</p>

<p>Such a contention would be valid, as no building can be made completely air-tight, said Sandro Zuliani, president and CEO of Crossbridge Condominium Services, a property manager for about 80,000 units in the Greater Toronto Area.</p>
<p>“You can never wrap it in Saran Wrap, per se, to prevent that smoke from migrating,” he said. “Even someone going out onto their balcony, the smoke can make its way into an adjoining unit.</p>
<p>“What the solution is, you make the building completely smoke-free.”</p>
<p><strong>READ MORE: <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/4331640/canadian-insurance-covering-medical-marijuana/">Why Canadian insurers are wary of covering medical marijuana</a></strong></p>
<p>Yet even going that route won’t necessarily mean a condo complex will be devoid of smoke: unit owners who already used tobacco prior to a smoking ban being instituted can seek to be “grandfathered,” meaning they would retain the right to continue puffing away.</p>
<p>Lash said in part it’s grandfathering that has lit a fire under many condo corporations to get expanded rules in place, to avoid residents using that loophole for recreational cannabis should buildings miss the Oct. 17 deadline.</p>
<p>Also of concern is residents cultivating marijuana plants – legislation will allow four per household for recreational users, six or more for medicinal users – because even such mini grow-ops can cause damaging moisture and mould in units.</p>

<p>“So we’re taking the position of no cultivation,” Lash said of drawing up rule-change documents for clients.</p>
<p>While condo corps in Toronto and many other cities across the country are rushing to get new rules passed by their building’s boards of directors, Vancouver and other West Coast communities have been able to take a much more mellow approach.</p>
<p>“It’s not really a new scenario in the sense that strata (condo) corporations across British Columbia have had no-smoking bylaws for probably five to 10 years already,” said Tony Gioventu, executive director of the Condominium Home Owners Association of BC.</p>
<p>“And so with respect to any type of consumption of a combustible, whether it’s tobacco, marijuana or any other substance, there’s an extensive list of strata corporations that have already started prohibiting consumption,” he said from Vancouver.</p>

<p>“There was so much anticipation that this was going to be a bigger issue, and it turns out in British Columbia to be not that much of an issue because we already have built into our legislation a nuisance bylaw which applies to any type of nuisance created from one strata lot or a common area into another unit.”</p>
<p>Gioventu said some condo corporations will make special accommodations for residents authorized to smoke medical marijuana and to propagate plants for that use within their units.</p>
<p>Still, that could pit a medicinal pot smoker against a neighbour who complains about contamination of their living space, conceivably triggering a human rights complaint by either party.</p>

		</p>
<p>“It becomes a human rights Catch-22,” said Gioventu. “Who has the greater rights of the two parties?</p>
<p>“Sometimes both rights are met. Some circumstances require modifications to the ventilation system in the building to accommodate both parties.”</p>
<p>As for Major, he would consider taking his case to Ontario’s Human Rights Tribunal if rules come into force in his condo that would prohibit him from smoking or vaping cannabis, along with the oils and tinctures he takes to control his multiple symptoms.</p>
<p>Otherwise, he’d likely have to give up the no-stairs, no-maintenance benefits of condo living and move again to a house.</p>
<p>“It would put me back to what I didn’t want to be doing, which is worrying about cutting grass, shovelling snow,” said Major, who has already fallen and broken a hip due to osteoporosis.</p>
<p>“Or then I get my wife to do it, and it’s just one more thing that she gets to do.”</p>

<p>“It would put me back to what I didn’t want to be doing, which is worrying about cutting grass, shovelling snow,” said Major, who has already fallen and broken a hip due to osteoporosis.</p>
<p>“Or then I get my wife to do it, and it’s just one more thing that she gets to do.”</p>

<p>The graphic designers hired to create a logo for Ontario’s legal marijuana retail stores faced a strange balancing act.</p>
<p>It should be “contemporary, not trendy,” “authoritative, not bureaucratic,” and “distinct, not complex,” according to documents released under access-to-information laws by the Liquor Control Board of Ontario. It should also convey “social acceptability, social responsibility and distinctiveness from the current illicit market.”</p>
<p>Does the final result, <a href="https://ocscannabisupdates.com/update-new-agency-brand-name-and-logo-details-on-online-and-in-store-technology-board-of-directors/">announced in March</a>, accomplish all of that? Well, you be the judge (see above.)</p>
<p>The black-and-white design was <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2018/03/09/ontario-cannabis-store_a_23381832/?utm_campaign=canada_dau">widely criticized as boring</a>, and the cost of the $650,000 contract, which included all aspects of the OCS’s design from signs to employee uniforms, <a href="https://www.blogto.com/city/2018/03/people-cant-believe-how-much-lbco-paid-its-new-cannabis-store-logo/">struck some as excessive</a>.</p>

				LCBO releases logos for ‘Ontario Cannabis Store,’ and people are underwhelmed			</a><br />
		</strong>
		</p>
<p>The designers also had to choose a colour palette, which they said should be “inviting, not youthful,” “sophisticated, not stuffy,” and “natural, not hippy” (their spelling.)</p>
<p>It is not clear in the documents whether these are criteria the ad agency, <a href="http://www.leoburnett.ca/contact-us/">Leo Burnett</a>, came up with on its own or whether they were based on instructions from the LCBO.</p>
<p>The natural choice, the agency concluded, was based on green.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Not surprisingly, green is the most popular colour within the cannabis sector,” the designers concluded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“It has become a shorthand that quickly conveys the botanical nature of the product.”</p>

<p>How and why they were overruled isn’t clear in the documents.</p>
<p>“The colour green and leaf imagery are commonly used in the cannabis industry — the OCS logo is intended to differentiate itself as the legal retailer of recreational cannabis,” LCBO spokesperson <span class="st">Nicole Laoutaris wrote in an e-mail. </span></p>

<p>The logo’s extreme plainness reflects a discomfort with the whole concept of marijuana legalization, argues Ottawa lawyer Trina Fraser.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s puritanical, and it’s paternalistic.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“It’s ridiculous. I get the LCBO notifications pinging me constantly, saying <a href="https://twitter.com/search?l=&amp;q=gin%20from%3Alcbo&amp;src=typd&amp;lang=en">‘It’s gin month at the LCBO!’</a> They certainly don’t hold back on the promotion of alcohol. But we’re not of the same mindset yet with cannabis.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if it’s just government that thinks society’s not ready, or if government’s not ready and society is — it’s probably a combination of the two things.”</p>

<p>To a certain extent, federal rules forbid marijuana advertising that could be interpreted as a promotion, Fraser says, though there is no mention of legal constraints in the documents obtained by Global News. An image of a marijuana leaf should be fine legally, Fraser says.</p>

<p>The logo is meant to “convey a safe, simple, open and approachable environment for consumers in a clear and easily understood way,” <span class="st">Laoutaris</span> wrote.</p>
<p>The documents have very little of the LCBO’s communications with the agency; it’s not clear what instructions Leo Burnett was working from to come up with the kind of result it did.</p>
<p>The documents make reference to a shortlist of three designs, but only the final choice is included.<span class="st"> Laoutaris</span> wrote that the rejected designs were “advice and recommendations (and) would not be disclosed.”</p>
<p>“For confidentiality reasons we are unable to speak about the details of the creative process that happens on behalf of our clients,” Leo Burnett’s Canadian CEO, Judy John, wrote in an e-mail.</p>

<p>A lawsuit against the small southern California city of Fontana could determine just how much local officials can push back on state laws legalizing cannabis. The American Civil Liberties Union and Drug Policy Alliance are challenging the city’s personal cultivation <a href="https://www.fontana.org/DocumentCenter/View/18793/Recreational-Indoor-Marijuana-Cultivation-Application-and-Requirements">permit requirements</a>, which bar those convicted of a recent felony related to a controlled substance or people who have accrued city fines from growing cannabis at home — a core part of the state’s legalization.</p>
<p>The question of local power has become one of the most fundamental and tense political dynamics playing out in the United States and Canada as cannabis is legalized.  </p>
<p>In Michigan, Detroit officials passed regulations, later reversed, that <a href="https://cannabiswire.com/2018/07/10/lawmaker-inaction-shapes-cannabis-in-michigan-as-legalization-heads-to-the-ballot-box/">effectively eliminated</a> nearly the entire city for those seeking licenses to sell medical cannabis. Voters in Massachusetts, for example, have legalized recreational use cannabis but some local officials have <a href="https://cannabiswire.com/2018/07/03/massachusetts-cautious-cannabis-sales-rollout-reflects-northeast-climate/">not made cannabis widely available</a> to consumers by banning sales. In Canada, Quebec has <a href="https://cannabiswire.com/2018/07/02/canada-paves-a-new-path-to-legal-cannabis/">taken on</a> the federal government by banning home cultivation of cannabis for recreational use, which is not allowed under the country’s new legalization plan. </p>
<p>Even in progressive California, conservative politics and local opposition to legalization have contributed to an anti-cannabis environment in much of the vast state since the passage of legalization initiative Proposition 64 in November 2016. </p>
<p>Fontana, a city of 200,000 in San Bernardino County in southern California, has some of the most restrictive regulations when it comes to personal cultivation, attorneys for the ACLU and Drug Policy Alliance told <em>Cannabis Wire</em>. Prop 64 allowed localities to ban, or pass its own regulation of, commercial activity while allowing smaller amounts of cannabis for personal use. It sought to enshrine recreational use as a <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB94">right for individuals</a> but allowed localities to pass “reasonable” regulations. </p>
<p>In response to Prop 64, the Fontana City Council passed Ordinance 1758, which not only required an application to home grow, but that applicants pay a $411 <a href="https://www.fontana.org/DocumentCenter/View/2271/Planning-Cases-and-Application-Fee">fee</a>, complete a criminal background check and adhere to strict rules on the areas where the plants could be cultivated, among other unusual provisions.</p>
<p>The ACLU and DPA are focused on ensuring that people are able to exercise the now-legal California right to grow personal use cannabis, DPA attorney Tamar Todd told <em>Cannabis Wire</em>. </p>
<p>“Whether an individual has the right to use … needs to be enforced statewide and not locality by locality,” Todd said.</p>
<p>But because cannabis remains illegal under federal law, some local California officials feel justified in cracking down or setting tight boundaries, said Julie Hamill, an attorney who represents cannabis businesses with the Seattle-based law firm Harris Bricken. </p>
<p>Nearly three-quarters of California localities ban all outdoor cultivation, and around 70 cities require residents to either register or get permits to grow for personal use, according to a report by the <a href="http://www.thecannifornian.com/cannabis-business/database-see-cannabis-laws-support-differ-among-california-cities/">Southern California News Group</a>, which analyzed local ordinances in the state’s 482 cities and 58 counties. Most of the state’s smaller cities — 431 of them — ban both recreational and medical cannabis sales, according to the database.</p>
<p>“[Local officials] are chest pounding, ‘We’re going to enforce the law and this is illegal!’” Hamill told <em>Cannabis Wire</em>. “In Hermosa Beach, you have 71% of people who voted for the ballot initiative but they don’t want these people in their backyard. For a lot of elected officials it’s a scary position to take to be progressive on it.”</p>
<p>Hermosa Beach, a beach city in Los Angeles County, lodged its official opposition to Prop 64 in a <a href="http://www.hermosabch.org/modules/showdocument.aspx?documentid=8565">letter on the city’s website</a>, citing the potential for youth to have greater access to the drug and worries about impaired drivers leading to marijuana-related driving deaths. “These risks are too severe to ignore,” Hermosa Beach then-Mayor Hany Fangary wrote. </p>
<p>The surrounding county of San Bernardino has made its opposition to legalized cannabis loud and clear, too. The statewide ballot proposals that legalized medical marijuana in 1996 and Prop 64’s passage in 2016 “does not require California cities and counties to allow commercial cannabis activity,” the county posted on its <a href="http://www.sbcounty.gov/uploads/cao/feature/content/commercial_cannabis_faq_180228.pdf">website</a>. </p>
<p>Other cities like Oakland and San Francisco are going the opposite direction, part of a rise in efforts aimed at ameliorating the effects of cannabis prohibition, either by giving priority cannabis business licenses to those affected or clearing their convictions. Conversely, San Bernardino District Attorney Mike Ramos, an opponent of Prop 64, has said he would not automatically remove cannabis-related convictions from offenders’ records, according to the <a href="http://www.vvdailypress.com/news/20180208/da-wont-direct-clean-sweep-of-pot-convictions-in-san-bernardino-county">Daily Press</a>.</p>
<p>The joint ACLU and DPA lawsuit, which is scheduled to be heard on September 14 in San Bernardino Superior Court, alleges the city’s true intention was to make the requirements so onerous that it would act as an effective ban. </p>
<p>“They want access to what is now legal,” Todd said of the lawsuit’s intent to rectify the drug war’s inequitable effect on minorities for crimes now considered to be much more socially acceptable. Onerous regulations, Todd said, creates “pockets where the harms of criminalization continue to exist.”</p>
<p>A Fontana city spokesperson declined to comment on the lawsuit and Fontana city Mayor Acquanetta Warren did not respond to an email. The city acted “fully within the duty, authority, or rights given to it,” the city said in a response to the suit filed with the court, but attorneys didn’t elaborate on why officials felt the regulations were necessary. The city has not received any permit applications for indoor cultivation, city spokesperson Martha Guzman-Hurtado told <em>Cannabis Wire</em> in an email. </p>
<p>City Council members worried Fontana didn’t have the resources to regulate personal cultivation and that people who grow should be regulated like businesses, according to an account of the initial 2017 debate in the <a href="https://www.fontanaheraldnews.com/news/fontana-city-council-approves-ordinance-allowing-homeowners-to-grow-marijuana/article_50c2d876-e3f4-11e6-befa-83c9c64d74d1.html">Fontana Daily Herald</a>. Mayor Warren told the <a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2017/02/11/are-cities-new-marijuana-laws-about-safety-or-blocking-proposition-64/">OCRegister</a> the ordinance was aimed at safety concerns. “This town has been a town of safety,” she said. “And we’re trying with this initiative to make sure that we keep our residents safe – particularly our young people.” </p>
<p>The ACLU believes the safety requirements aren’t reasonable. “What Fontana did was a very clear example of what local governments can’t do,” ACLU attorney Bill Freeman told <em>Cannabis Wire</em>. “It’s a good place to make the point that local efforts to prevent personal cultivation are improper.”</p>
<p>The ordinance “requires applicants to make self-incriminating statements in their permit applications, statements that admit to a violation of federal law and that federal authorities could easily obtain,” the ACLU and DPA lawsuit says. “It also requires citizens to submit to (and pay for) a warrantless search of their homes by government agents … Under the terms of the Ordinance, a resident of the City cannot grow six marijuana plants—an activity the State has declared to be lawful—if he or she, for example, owes a library fine, fails to update a pet license, or has unpaid parking tickets.”</p>
<p>Another lawsuit filed against the city of Colton, located less than 10 miles from Fontana, also takes aim at the city’s <a href="http://ca-colton.civicplus.com/DocumentCenter/View/3594">ordinance</a>, which requires a <a href="http://ca-colton.civicplus.com/DocumentCenter/View/3636.pdf">permit</a> for indoor cultivation — and where officials aren’t accepting any new applications. </p>
<p>The city’s permit requirements were taken down recently, because the city’s initial application period from March 1 to April 30 has expired, Mark Tomich, director of Colton’s development services, wrote in an email to <em>Cannabis Wire</em>. The city didn’t receive any permit applications during that time. A City Council subcommittee is studying the issue and plans to recommend changes to the process, he said. City Manager Bill Smith declined to comment on the pending lawsuit.</p>
<p>That case is scheduled to be heard October 26, according to <a href="http://openaccess.sb-court.org/OpenAccess/CIVIL/default.asp">court records</a>. </p>
