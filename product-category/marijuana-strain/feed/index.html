		<description><![CDATA[<p>Aside from this strain’s tendency to branch out and lean in all directions, especially as the flowers start to develop and get heavier, growers have reported that A-Train prefers lower humidity environments. While it grows well in all mediums, the yields tend to be higher in hydroponic systems, and the taste comes out more when grown in soil.</p>
<p>When smoked, it has a slightly lemony flavor with unmistakable undertones of Trainwreck, although a bit subdued by the hashy indica taste of the Afghani genetics. This strain smokes smooth like a sativa, but has a kick of an indica – a perfect hybrid!</p>
<p>One of the most pronounced effects of smoking A-Train is the munchies, which makes it a good choice for medical cannabis users that need help stimulating their appetite. Being a well balanced hybrid, A-Train is a perfect choice for users seeking the medicating effects of indica softened by the sativa side.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>60% Sativa / 40% Indica<br />
Genetics: Trainwreck x Mazar I Sharif<br />
Flowering: 55-60 days<br />
Height: 54-60 inches<br />
Yield: 250-350g per square meter<br />
This hybrid is a result of crossing two very well known strains that hold a special place in the medical cannabis community – Mazar I Sharif and Arcata e-32 Trainwreck. Mixing the genetics from these two strains, A-Train has inherited a pretty even mix of indica and sativa traits from it’s parents. Adding the Afghani indica genetics of Mazar I sharif to Arcata Trainwreck produced a plant that is more dense and not quite as tall as it’s California mother, although it still tends to grow wildly and requires a bit of support.</p>
<p>When growing A-Train, keep in mind that this strain can start flowering when it’s one foot tall, but will shoot up dramatically and finish around 4.5 to 5 feet. It is a moderate yielder, and on average, you can expect to harvest 300-350 grams of round, compact buds per square meter.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>It’s a common misconception that the strongest of the most famous strains are harder to grow, and AK-47 banishes this myth by being particularly simple to cultivate. It can grow in any environment but prefers indoor setups, where it will grow out in 10 days from clone. These seedlings will only ever get to a medium height, making a lack of space not a problem. Their growth is vigorous, however, and if you plan on topping, you’re going to need to give the plants some support as they mature.</p>
<p>A flowering time of 60 days is usual, and from this you can harvest up to 500 grams per square yard of grow room. The compact nugs are a sight to behold, with a thick coat of crystals and hardly any leaves, and it’ll be tough to keep your hands off them until they’ve properly cured!</p>
<p>One thing to consider when growing AK-47 is that the closer your buds get to harvest, the more they will stink. And I’m not talking a bit of a stench in the hallway, I’m talking the neighbors in the next street getting high off the smell. Don’t worry though, some carbon filters should sort that right out, but when you start your grow, be aware that odor might be an issue and choose a grow space accordingly.</p>
<p>Like its namesake, AK-47 has very powerful effects, but rather than knocking you down brain dead, it will leave you with a nice, balanced high, affecting both head and body, although if you carry on toking, you’ll find yourself with a serious head high. It’s definitely a one hit wonder, though, and even if you are a daily smoker, you’ll be left a little blown away by its potency.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>65% Sativa / 35% Indica<br />
Origins: Colombian, Mexican, Thai &amp; Afghani<br />
Flowering: 56-63 days<br />
Harvest: mid/late October<br />
Yield: 350 – 500 gr/m2<br />
A truly classic strain, AK-47 has been around since the early 1990s. This sativa dominant hybrid was reworked and stabilized by Serious Seeds in 1999. Since then, AK-47 has won multiple Cannabis Cups and awards, and her genetics have been used to create crosses by many cannabis breeders.</p>
<p>A relatively small but influential seed company, Serious Seeds provide product to many of the Amsterdam coffeeshops. Thanks to this, as well as their penchant for creating varieties that blow others out of the waster, their strains have been much sought after. AK-47 is one of their most infamous strains, and for good reason; as well as being a complete knockout high, it is parent to many modern strains, including the auto flowering Cetme from Pit Bully Seeds and Serious Seeds’ own White Russian.</p>
<p>AK-47 is a complex mix of Colombian, Mexican, Thai, and Afghani genetics that only a master breeder like Simon from Serious Seeds could manage. It is one of the most well-known contemporary strains and one of the most hard hitting – it’s no coincidence that it was named after the most lethal rifle in the world.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to growing AK-48, it is a very hardy plant which makes it a great choice for beginners. On the other hand, experienced growers can push this plant, making it ready for harvest in just under 7 weeks.</p>
<p>Nirvana recommends planting 16 plants per square meter, then pruning each plant to only 6 branches and the top in order to optimize the size and bud consistency throughout the crop. She loves to be grown in soil, and does great in sea of green type gardens.</p>
<p>AK-48 has a sweet, flowery, and somewhat earthy taste when smoked, and produces a happy, euphoric, sativa like high. Medical cannabis users have reported this strain to be very beneficial when dealing with stress or depression.300</p>

Genetics: Colombian Gold x Thai x Mexican x Afghani<br />
Flowering: 48-63 days<br />
Harvest: October<br />
Height: medium<br />
Yield: 400 – 500 g/m² in SOG<br />
Since it’s first introduction in the 1990s, AK cannabis genetics have been increasingly popular among both marijuana growers and users. Nirvana’s version of this plant, the AK-48, is known for it’s potency and an extremely quick finishing time. While it’ll usually be ready for harvest around 9 weeks, when grown in optimal conditions, this plant can finish in as little as 48 days.</p>
<p>Although AK-48 is an indica dominant hybrid genetically, it has retained most of the a sativa qualities when it comes to smell, taste, and especially the high. These plants produce hard, dense buds that are covered in trichomes and have a very pungent aroma.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Kaya finishes in 8-9 weeks indoors, or around October outdoors in Spain or similar climates. She is resistant to pests and tolerates heat well. When grown indoors, her compact branching makes her a good candidate for sea of green. Her branches grow outward in moderation and stay thick enough to hold her buds, so when grown as a multibranch plant, pruning and branch supports are seldom necessary. Outdoors, or in a greenhouse with huge pots of soil, Kaya can also be grown to huge sizes. She performs best when allowed to reach around a meter before including flowering. The plants will finish around 6 feet. Because of her hardiness, Kaya is a good plant for outdoor guerilla grows, perfect for leaving somewhere with a global positioning system and finding again in the autumn.</p>
<p>Kaya has a spicy flavor, refreshingly different from skunk, with a sweet kiss that lingers on the tongue. The high is also different from the punchout associated with some popular “skunk” strains – a return to the mellower potencies of days gone by. “Lighter highs,” says Nirvana, “definitely have theirr place and their fans”. Kaya is unlikely to waylay lightweight smokers on the first bong hit, and she is a great daytime friend to those who prefer a high that is more like a “snack” than a “meal”, a stone that is easier to moderate. For both gardeners and tokers, Kaya is easy to get along with.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indica 55 / Sativa 45<br />
Origins: Mexican Sativa x Top 44<br />
Flowering: 56-63 days<br />
Harvest: mid October</p>
<p>Nirvana created this strain as a mellow sativa option for novice indoor growers, and outdoor growers in rough climates. They started with a beautifully, hardy, stable Mexican sativa, reminiscent of old strains in her more mellow potency and agreeable nature. This strain was crossed with Top 44, one of their best selling commercial varieties. Top 44 has become popular in Holland for her easy cultivation, fast finish (just over six weeks in perfect conditions), and compact profile. Nirvana breeders forced a female Top 44 o develop male flowers using giberellic acid. The resulting strain, Kaya, is feminized, meaning that ll her seeds are females. These parents have produced an easygoing plant that beginners will enjoy growing.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>As this strain is only slightly sativa dominant, it can be grown in fairly small areas and grow rooms that don’t have the space for huge monster plants. She can be grown on a 12/12 light cycle from the very beginning, and on this sort of schedule will be fully finished in just 90 days. The plant will develop a large and dense central cola surrounded by a good amount of secondary buds, creating a fantastic looking plant that can be kept to very small sizes. I know of one grower who kept the plant to less than one foot tall in a grow inside a PC case. Of course, such small plants will give less bud, but for some, quality is more important than quantity.</p>
<p>The ease of growing Kaya 47 makes it an absolutely phenomenal choice for the first time growers, although of course more experienced cultivators will be able to use their own tricks to get even more out of this plant. Cutting back the fan leaves can be a good plan, and a good long flush with black molasses can help bring out the natural flavors of this strain and get rid of any chemical aftertaste that might linger in the finished buds. If you’re really going for the ultimate win, team these molasses with organic bee honey and you’ll have a smoke that is second to none.</p>
<p>Much like its parent strain, Kaya 47 is a one hitter quitter; all but the most experienced of smokers will only need a toke or two before they’re flat on their ass wondering what the hell just happened. The long lasting effects will leave you well medicated but also mellow, with enough mental activity coming back after a little while to keep you from being totally zombified. Rookie smokers should definitely be wary of getting carried away with this strain, as their virgin lungs are likely to be shocked by the strength of this strain and might run terrified into the woods to hide.</p>

Flowering: 8-9 weeks<br />
Yield: 400 – 500 g/m2<br />
THC: 22%<br />
AK-47 has been one of the big names in modern cannabis strains since it first burst onto the scene back in 1992, when Bill Clinton was on his way in and New Kids on the Block were on their way out. The guys at Advanced Seeds have obviously seen this strain’s stratospheric rise in popularity, and with all the confidence of Icarus, have taken an already great strain and made it even better.</p>
<p>By breeding AK-47 with some of their own fantastic genetics, they have created a strain that might even surpass its parent plant. Kaya 47 is a fast flowering, heavier yielding version of AK-47, and the quality of this plant means that for Advanced Seeds, there’s definitely not going to be a fall back to Earth.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>KC 33 was developed with the outdoor grower in mind, but can be grown indoors as a large plant with a yield of up to 600g using 600wpm. A sea of green method is discouraged. outdoors, she loves moisture and will thrive even in cool, wet weather. The Haze and Ukraninan parents are known to reach gigantic heights. Inheriting this height, KC 33 can be planted later in the season than is customary to steer clear of her leggy qualities while still bringing in a generous yield before the first frost. Alternately, outdoor growers can use a covering system to reduce light hours and finish plants when most gardens are just entering flowering phase. The stretchy height has also been put to use by trellising this variety and growing horizontally.</p>
<p>KC 33 has enormous leaves and enormous sweet, sticky, light green buds with a distinctive lemon taste that is fresh on the palate. Smoking KC 33 results in a light unencumbered buzz that settles into the head instead of the body.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indica 60 / Sativa 40<br />
Origins: Afghani x Haze x Ukrainian strain<br />
Flowering: 63-77 days<br />
Harvest: mid October</p>
<p>A Dutch breed with Afghani and Eastern European progenitors, KC 33 got her name by the way of the breeder’s age in 1993 when she was developed. KC received the parent Afghani strain from a friend who had adapted the strain over 29 years of growing in the Netherlands. This was crossed with a Haze and another early flowering plant from the Ukraine. The result is a plant that can finish in Holland as early as August and as late as October outdoors, depending on the time it is planted.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>At maturity, the plants to begin to use less water, the deep green leaves start to yellow, and the buds develop red-brown pistils. Trichomes form a thick carpet on the leaves and buds. They do not at all need to be milky to be harvest ready. Though predominantly indica, the open plant structure and the low leaf ration makes Anesthesia easy to trim. The Herijuana-dominant phenotypes finish first and are also the most compact and most resinous. A separate mixed phenotype finishes a little slower and has the best combination of dark musky taste and potency. Don’t let the modest size of the colas mislead you – their dense chunkiness means they weigh in heavy and explode in the grinder. Since these plants have a tight bud structure, it is best to avoid high humidity during the last weeks of flowering.</p>
<p>Anesthesia is named for the narcotic, body stone that its smoke induces. By definition, “anesthesia” is a state in which awareness of pain or discomfort in the body is reduced, and relaxing or sedative effect is created. The Anesthesia variety causes a deep physical mellowing that slowly works through one’s limbs like a warm blanket, while allowing the mind to stay engaged. As a medicinal strength strain, it may be too potent to be enjoyable for beginners or casual recreational smokers. However, patients who rely on indica body effects but want to stay mentally alert will enjoy the balance of these qualities. The old school taste is earthy and dark, with a hint of coffee tones that will appeal to fans of deep hashy flavors.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indica<br />
Origins: Afghan Skunk x Herijuana<br />
Flowering: 64-70 days</p>
<p>Anesthesia was developed specifically to keep the Afghani Skunk alive. A classic among old-school strains, the original Afghani Skunk was passed along to a breeder Whazzup as a clone from a renowned veteran grower who had grown the strain for many years. Sannie’s Herijuana was selected as the father in order to add medicinal strength and a more open structure to the indica density of the Afghani. Anesthesia’s original mother was vegetated outdoors, then pollinated and bloomed in an indoor garden. The result is a smoke with a distinctly earthy Afghan flavor and a deeply relaxing buzz.</p>
<p>Anesthesia starts as a low branchy plant with broad indica leaves. When grown from seed, these plants branch extensively and yield better with ample space, but they still tend to form ane large dense main cola. Anesthesia prefers a calcium-rich substrate, but all growing techniques and mediums are okay. In a sea of green method, gardeners should plant no more than nine plants per square meter. It is also great for screen of green gardens due to the branching and open structure. This wide plant needs generous floor space to reach its full potential. Whazzup recommends 4-5 plants per square meter when grown as multi-branch plants from cuttings. Anesthesia shows gender relatively late. As she enters flowering, the growth speeds up, and she doubles in size, reaching between 3.5 and 4 feet (1 meter) in height.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>A breeder’s tip is to keep the plants fairly cool, and be very careful when applying nutrients. Flowering time is 12 weeks indoors, and bring sure to bring some friends around harvest time, as these buds are a hell of a job to trim!</p>
<p>All your hard work will pay off as a few puffs on a pipe of Amnesia will have you soaring, exuberant and alive. A few more puffs, though, and you might not even remember where you put the stash. Did I leave it in the fridge? What’s your name again?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Genetics: Neville’s Haze x Afghani<br />
Flowering: 12 weeks<br />
Harvest: late October<br />
You might not have heard of Hy-Pro, but you’ll definitely have heard of Amnesia: one of the most well known sativa dominant strains in recent history. Curiously, it wasn’t created by one of the big name breeders, but a guy at a nutrient company who had the magic touch. A blend of Neville’s Haze and Afghani genetics, Amnesia took the pot world by storm and continues to do so, with so many Amnesia crosses on the market that it’s impossible to keep track.</p>
<p>Though Amnesia is an unfussy strain, it grows best in soil containers and doesn’t like to get too dry, so be careful to keep it moist at all times. Outdoors, these plants can easily reach 10 feet, so don’t plant them too early in the season if you want to tame them; planting later will limit their growing time in the vegetative stage.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>KC-36 shows her strong indica influence in her wide, webbed, dark green leaves; in her bushy stature, and eventually, in her dense and compact buds, profuse with crystal formations like the signature frost of her White Widow mother. She is a multi-brancher, with tight buds forming in many locations. She tends to have an asymetrical profile because some of her branches stick out.</p>
<p>This vigorous northern plant can adjust to variable weather conditions and withstands both cold weather and moisture in moderate doses. She has shown some mold resistance when faced with wet conditions. KC-36 is also quite smelly, which may be a disadvantage if countermeasures are not in place or the outdoor location is not remote enough from curious neighbors.</p>
<p>KC-36 has a fast onset, powerful body high. The inhale is expansive, with a floral spice reminiscent of White Widow. Its smoke is likely to cause little coughing spells, followed by smiles and body relaxation. This is more of a cozy afternoon smoke than a party pot. KC recommends it for a lazy day of hanging with friends, for an enhanced sense of peace when out in nature, or as a nice enhancement for a good movie or CD. Anecdotally, it’s good medicine for migraines and hyperactivity.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indica 85 / Sativa 15<br />
Origins: White Widow x KC 606<br />
Flowering: 56-70 days<br />
Harvest: late September</p>
<p>KC-36 is a mostly indica strain that is a great choice for outdoor growers in temperate regions. This strain was bred specifically to thrive at high lateitudes. It flourishes indoors and out, and can be grown in Holland or at equivalent distances from the equator with a finishing time at the end of September. In fact, it will flower too early if attempted outdoors in more southerly latitudes.</p>
<p>As an indoor plant, KC-36 finishes in eight to ten weeks. She stays small and compact, making her great for indoor growers with space limitations. Outdoors, KC-36 will reach moderate heights, around 5-6 feet. KC Brains recommends growing in hydro indoors, but suggests that outdoor grows in soil should consider organics in order to allow the buds to bring their best qualities forward in the harvest.</p>

<p>While KC-45 can be grown under lights, it is more appropriate for outdoor gardens. This multi-branched plant grows best in soil, especially with an organic fertilizing program. Once it roots, KC-45 will grow to a nearly 7-foot-tall Christmas tree, whose impressively long branches remain bare of leaves near the stem, but support meter-long colas. In outdoor environments, this plant will ripen by September 15; indoors, it takes 8-10 weeks to finish flowering.</p>
<p>Indoor plants are very high yielders, and outdoor yields can weigh in at over 3 pounds per plant. The buds that form are long and cylindrical. The colas are compact but not tight, because the individual flowers that make up the cola are slender rather than plump.</p>
<p>The smell from this plant is localized, but will burst with a strong lemon odor when touched. When smoked, the KC-45 high comes on rapid and strong. It retains the uplifting stone of its Brazilian sativa parentage, but modified a bit by the ruderalis, making this smoke less hyper than a pure sativa. The result is an energetic yet calm and settling high, well suited to gardening, hiking or leisurely sports. Medicinally, this variety has provided relief to some migraine sufferers and also is good for any condition which causes lethargy, as it can improve energy levels.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sativa 50 / Ruderalis 50<br />
Origins: Russian Ruderalis x Brazilian Sativa<br />
Flowering: 56-70 days<br />
Harvest: mid September</p>
<p>The KC-45 is an unusual variety among the many selections on the market due to her partial ruderalis heritage. Ruderalis is a distinct Russian subspecies of cannabis whose most notable characteristic is autoflowering. Unlike indica and sativa strains, ruderalis is not triggered into flowering based on the number of hours of darkness. Ruderalis begins flowering automatically after growing to a certain age, even outdoors in her native Russia. KC’s ruderalis-sativa hybrid, KC-45, bounces back from stress conditions and can perform in cloudy weather due to its ruderalis mother’s minimal need for externally triggered flowering. Meanwhile, its sativa father ensures a strong, euphoric high.</p>
