<p>Our go-to strain for the 2017 outdoor hemp season in Nevada.  Please read:  This strain contains mild seeds and is untrimmed so you get the most bang for your buck!  Cherry Wine has a rich terpene profile with high levels of Caryophyllene, which is ideal for daily use and can help combat inflammation.  This cbd hemp flower was curated by our team of Cannabidiol (CBD) artisans and handled with care.  We carefully place all quantities of cbd hemp flower in a pharmaceutical grade white mylar bag then heat seal it for freshness and to omit any odors.  The bags are then placed in bubble wrap pouches and inserted into the appropriate mailer, envelope or box.</p>
<p>All online orders are packaged discreetly in the order they are received.  Priority shipping and handling is included in all prices.  We are currently running at a 1-day handling time but do our best to get packages out the same day.  Orders placed after 2 PM do go out the next business day.  After making your purchase, Godaddy (the webserver) will send an order confirmation along with a receipt via email.  We (the merchant) will receive a copy as well so we can prepare the order and generate a shipping label.  Once the label is printed, you should receive an additional email notification that will include tracking information powered by shippo.com.  It's always best to track your shipment online, but we are always here to help with getting an update.  Please keep in mind, we are not the post office so our tracking information will be the same as what you can see online.  In the event the package does not make it to you, we will do our best to locate it and/or possibly file an insurance claim.  If the package was indeed lost and/or a claim awarded, we will resend the order at no additional cost.  Please note, we do not cover package theft.  If the tracking says delivered, we assume the package has been delivered.  If you decide to file a claim with your card company as "package not received," we will blacklist you for making any future purchases.</p>

California’s and Nevada’s respective Departments of Agriculture have certified, registered, and regulated the growing of our industrial hemp in conformance with federal and state laws, rules, and regulations. Federal law, in particular, 7 U.S.C. §5940(b)(1), entitled “Legitimacy of Industrial Hemp Research,” encourages growing, cultivating, and marketing industrial hemp products pursuant to these pilot programs, and by the rights and protections thereby established, <span class="x-el x-el-span px_-text-transform-none px_-fs-unset px_-ff-_Source_Sans_Pro___arial__sans-serif px_-text-decoration-underline x-d-ux"><span class="x-el x-el-span px_-text-transform-none px_-fs-unset px_-ff-_Source_Sans_Pro___arial__sans-serif px_-fw-700 x-d-ux">CBDHemp.direct</span></span> proudly offers this legal industrial hemp flower high in cannabidiol (CBD) in the United States.<br />
According to 7 U.S.C. §5940, the term “industrial hemp” means the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of such plant, whether growing or not, with a Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta-9 THC) concentration of not more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis. Only the Delta-9 THC level is relevant, not THC-A. As shown by the enclosed Certificate of Analysis, this hemp flower has a Delta-9 THC level on a dry weight basis equal to 0%, well below the 0.3% maximum level and, therefore, this flower is hemp, not marijuana, and is perfectly legal to possess and sell. This right applies in any state pursuant to the Full Faith and Credit Clause, Article VI, Section 1 of the Constitution, the Supremacy Clause, Article VI, Section 2 of the Constitution, and the Equal Protection Clause, Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Global CBD  Hemp  Flower is now legal to buy and sell in all 50 states!</p>
<p>Global CBD Hemp Flower is a full spectrum plant flower that contains essential fatty acids, protein, vitamins, minerals, terpenes, aromatic molecules and CBD. Each one of our strains on our site has a different look and smell. They also provide slightly different effects.</p>
<p>The CHERRY WINE strain has less than .3% Delta 9 THC which is the legal limit of THC and if you are consuming in moderation you will not fail a drug test, but we do not make any guarantees. See our FAQ page on our site to learn more.</p>
<p>Here at Global CBD Hemp quality and safety is very important so each and every batch of CBD flower is tested and approved by the Department of Agriculture prior to distribution.</p>
<p>It is highly advised to act responsibly and treat this like a cannabis product, as it does look and smell like marijuana. empirewellness.com is not responsible for anyone confiscating this product or getting arrested or fined for having this legal product in your possession because of the misconception of what it actually is. Buy and consume at your own risk.</p>
<p><strong>Notice to law enforcement authorities:</strong> What is contained on this page might look like marijuana, but it is actually legal industrial hemp flower. This historic legislation establishes the legality of industrial hemp produced in state pilot agricultural programs. Congress provides the requisite definition for allowable amounts of THC. industrial hemp&#8217; means the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of such plant, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis”. An important legal distinction also appears in the first sentence of this bill, stating: “Notwithstanding the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act (20 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.), chapter 81 of title 41, United States Code, or any other Federal law”. The term “notwithstanding” was widely used by the 114th Congress as a way to supersede previous laws that may apply, without going through the process of overturning them. This confirms that hemp cannot be considered “marijuana” under the CSA.<br />
Consolidated Appropriations Act, Sec. 763 (2016)<br />
This legislation was the omnibus federal budget for FY2016. According to 7 U.S.C. §5940, the term “industrial hemp” means the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of such plant, whether growing or not, with a Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta-9 THC) concentration of not more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis.
