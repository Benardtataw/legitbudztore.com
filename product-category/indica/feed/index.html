<p>Aurora Indica cannabis strain, as its name suggests, is a heavily indica-dominant strain with a ratio of about 90/10. Its THC levels, however, are relatively low, clocking in at around 19% at most. It is a very fragrant strain, known for its soft lavender aroma and earthy undertones that remind users of wandering through a field of flowers. Its taste is similarly dreamy, with an herbal woody overtone and subtle hints of exotic spice.<br />
Type of High<br />
Aurora Indica is a heavily indica dominant hybrid (90% indica/10% sativa) strain created as a potent cross between the insanely popular Northern Lights X Afghan strains. This dank bud boasts a THC level that ranges from 14-19% on average and a myriad of indica effects. Users describe the Aurora Indica high as one that is definitely a creeper – the effects will slowly build on you, suddenly leaving you completely stoned and utterly couch-locked. This heavy physical high is accompanied by a slowly building and sedating cerebral calm that eventually eases you into a deep and peaceful sleep. Due to these potent effects, Aurora Indica is said to be an ideal strain for treating patients suffering from conditions such as ADD/ADHD, insomnia, and chronic pain due to injury or illness. Aurora Indica buds have an aroma of sweet earthy mango with a fragrant hint of lavender and a taste of earthy spicy mango that sweetens pleasantly upon exhale. These buds have thick oversized dense and greasy dark olive green spade-shaped nugs. These nugs are spattered with thick dark purple hairs and are frosty with a thick layer of crystal white trichomes and dripping with sweet sticky syrupy resin.</p>

<div class="s-info-desc__text">BF Blue Cheese cannabis strain is a pure indica. The herb has a delicious blueberry aroma and a rich, earthy flavour. The buds are recognizable by their medium-sized, spade-shaped dark forest green nugs. Look more closely and you will see each bud has rich purple undertones and hairs, as well as a fine layer of frosty white trichomes and sweet sticky resin.</div>

<div class="s-info-desc__text">BF Blue Cheese cannabis strain offers a slow burn that comes on strong. After a period of sedation, creativity, and clarity, you’ll likely sleep heavily. Needless to say, beginners should steer clear. Experienced smokers should only indulge at night.</div>

<div class="s-info-desc__text">Aka: Barney’s Farm Blue Cheese. Breeder: Unknown. Cannabis Genetics: 100% pure Indica strain. BF Blue Cheese cannabis strain is a three-way cross of Skunk #1, UK Cheese and Blueberry cannabis strains.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The aroma is a mix of blue cheese and sweet blueberries. The original Cheese strain, which was first bred in the United Kingdom, was bred with a Blueberry male, resulting in a name and a strain focused on the blue. The same definitely can&#8217;t be said of the high, a mix of joy and euphoria with deep-body relaxation. The indica is very apparent in the body high, while the sativa portion keeps the strain lively. Blue Cheese is a good choice when treating anxiety, depression, or pain, but it also works well on migraines, PTSD, ADHD, and bipolar disorder. Insomniacs can find strong relief in this strain as well. Dry mouth is possible, as are dry eyes. This strain is relatively easy to find in Colorado and the West Coast, less so elsewhere. Cheese and its offspring remain mostly a British phenomenon, but the unique flavor and aroma, coupled with a stress-reducing high perfect for late nights.</div>

<p>Blueberry Kush cannabis strain is a unique Indica originated from Oregon. It is considered to be one of the strongest medicinal strains on the market due to high potency. Blueberry Kush marijuana is a well deserved winner of 2000 High Times Cannabis Cup awards. Blueberry Kush cannabis is best for the evening and bedtime use as has deep sedative effects including heavy couch lock.<br />
Type of High<br />
Blueberry Kush marijuana strain induces heavy, sedative body buzz that creeps up very fast. Uplifts mood, alleviates depression. Relaxes the body, relieves stress, triggers laziness and couch lock. Has strong analgesic properties.<br />
Genetics<br />
Blueberry Kush cannabis strain is a cross between Blueberry and OG Kush.</p>
<p>This strain contains much lower amounts of CBD, however, much less than 1%. That&#8217;s too low to recommend Blueberry Kush as treatment for seizures and other conditions that respond to CBD. But it&#8217;s a good strain for treating anxiety, low mood, ADHD, migraine headaches, mood disorders, chronic pain, and nausea. The indica effects are deeply relaxing, happy, euphoric, and sleepy. That makes Blueberry Kush a great late-night strain and an effective way to treat insomnia. This strain has an earthy flavor and aroma with notes of berries and herbs. Dry mouth and dry eyes are widely reported as side effects, while dizziness, paranoia, and headaches are less likely. Popular up and down the West Coast, from Southern California to British Columbia, Blueberry Kush can also be found on the medical marijuana market in Arizona. It&#8217;s also a frequent find on the black market in many parts of the United States.</p>

<p>Northern Light x Bigbud cannabis strain is a pure Indica strain with a high THC average of 18% and a CBD average of 5%. The flavours are cheesy, fruity and herbal with spicy and woody notes. It is known to treat insomnia, anxiety and pain. This strain is ideal for evening usage.<br />
Type of High<br />
Northern Light x Bigbud cannabis strain&#8217;s high is greatly sedative and narcotically calming, along with its CBD-rich medicinal value.<br />
Genetics<br />
Genetics: Northern Light x Bigbud cannabis strain is a cross between Northern Light and Big Bud cannabis strains.</p>
<p>Originating from Holland, Northern Lights X Skunk is perhaps one of the most famous and potent strains. This Grade A  Indica is a medium green that surely has as many colored hairs as the northern lights themselves. With mostly bright golden hairs, this moderately fluffy strain is very sticky with white crystals coating it&#8217;s earthy surface. This adherent strain smells of sweet pine and sour lemon which is then accompanied by a tangy, earthy and smooth taste. Widely used for stress, anxiety, depression, nausea or acute pain, Northern lights give a great sense of euphoria with a relaxed and mellow sensation. The physical experience is more of a comfortable relaxation instead of one that will make you want to &#8220;get up and go&#8221;.</p>
