<p><b>Northern Lights Feminized</b> is a pure Afghani, feminized seed-strain with a short flowering time, plus amazing production and potency. If you’re looking for something quick and easy, these are great cannabis seeds to buy, even for beginners.</p>
<p>As a parent-plant for breeding new strains, the Northern Lights family is almost as popular as Skunk #1. NL has the same advantages of potency, yield and vigour, plus a much lower grow odour than any Skunk. A large proportion of high-power, high-yield cannabis hybrids gain their desirable qualities from the NL genes in their background!</p>
<p>Northern Lights has always been an extremely rewarding plant for indoor marijuana growers who now have the advantage of being able to choose an all-female version of this well-loved variety.</p>
<p>Northern Lights Feminized has very short internodal gaps and produces thick clusters of rock-solid buds with excellent resin production. Her smoke is full-bodied, sweet and acrid, with quite a subtle taste; many cannabis connoisseurs agree that NL’s main flavour is that of burning resin!</p>

<li><strong>Average height gain</strong>Northern Lights Feminized will have average height gain during flowering.</li>
<li><strong>Flowering 50 – 65 days</strong>Northern Lights Feminized will have a comparatively short flowering time.</li>
<li><strong>Yield Heavy Yield</strong>Northern Lights Feminized can produce a very large yield, but may require a little extra care to achieve their full potential.</li>
<li><strong>100% Indica </strong>The Northern Lights Feminized strain has large proportion of Indica genes in its background.</li>

<p>Northern Lights is a multiple award winning seed-strain with a reputation as one of the greatest Afghani-based cannabis Indica varieties of all time. A super-heavy yielding strain that can thrive vigorously in a variety of environments, Northern Lights should be on everybody’s must-have list. This weed commands serious respect from even highly experienced smokers thanks to the deep intense stone it imparts, and novices should approach the large sparkly buds with caution!</p>
<p>As a cultivar with a short flowering time, Northern Lights was a natural choice to recreate as an auto-flowering strain. The combination of the original Northern Lights genetics and those of one of the finest auto-flowering breeding strains has produced a feminized selection of seeds capable of maturing into a crop of fat buds ready to harvest in only a few weeks.</p>
<p>People who buy Northern Lights Automatic are investing in an excellent example of a low maintenance, high yielding Indica that lives up to the reputation of the original, and yet can even grow happily on a sunny windowsill!</p>

<p><b>Mexican Haze Feminized</b> is a mostly-Sativa strain. A blend of Jack Herer, Acapulco Gold and classic Haze, this feminized cannabis hybrid is already one of the more famous members of our seed collection due to her explosive cerebral high.</p>
<p>Mexican Haze is usually an indoor plant, and can also be grown outdoors in a sunny Mediterranean climate. People who buy Mexican Haze Feminized seeds can expect a beautiful, almost tropical garden of vivid green plants with branches that reach upwards vigorously, especially during the flowering period. Be prepared for plants that can quadruple in size by the time they are ready to harvest!</p>
<p>Her growth pattern is classic Sativa – tall and slender with long internodal gaps and an extensive flowering period – but the results are well worth every bit of extra effort!</p>
<p>This feminized cannabis strain produces a very heavy yield for a Haze; her buds are long, open and thick with resin. When smoked, Mexican Haze Feminized has a fresh, fruity taste and a staggering, almost hallucinogenic high.</p>

<p>Trainwreck meets Kush in a colossal cannabis pile-up of the finest indica and sativa genetics! K-Train Feminized combines Kush, one of the oldest, most powerful and best-loved indica strains from the mountains of India, with Trainwreck, a relative newcomer from the USA with an impressive sativa-dominant profile. The result is one of the most talked-about recent cannabis hybrids that money can buy!</p>
<p>K-Train Feminized delivers a long-lasting high – the sativa component is the most pronounced of her genetic traits and effects can last for several hours. Recommended as an easy-to-grow variety, K-Train Feminized seeds produce solid bushy plants with sturdy side branches that rapidly develop clusters of resinous buds.</p>
<p>Aromas of orange and sweet citrus with an earthy undertone develop during the flowering period and come to full strength, along with the uplifting effect, after curing the buds. The smoke is smooth and satisfying, yet so powerful that novice consumers are advised to take care when riding the K-Train for the first time!</p>

<p><b>Ice Feminized</b> is an Indica-Sativa hybrid with a very heavy yield. Indoors, this feminized cannabis variety is a good choice for people looking for a weed type to buy that works well in both hydro and soil systems. Ice Feminized seeds can also be grown outdoors in regions with a temperate or Mediterranean climate.</p>
<p>With the Ice Feminized seed-strain, we have successfully united quality and quantity. Her ancestors include an old-time Afghani, a very special Skunk, classic heavyweight Northern Lights and the world-famous Silver Haze. An exacting selection process involving thousands of plants was used to isolate and reinforce the special balance of qualities found in this feminized hybrid.</p>
<p>The buds produced by Ice Feminized are thickly coated with trichomes and have a very dense structure with a high flower-to-leaf ratio. Solid colas cover the upper sections of her main stem and branches.</p>
<p>Her effect is stoney and heavy with a rich, sweet, resinous flavour which contains hints of a sharp, almost astringent aroma.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Haze Automatic combines the uplifting effect of Haze, the classic <i>Cannabis sativa</i> strain, with the useful auto-flowering abilities of <i>Cannabis ruderalis</i> and the more compact stature of <i>Cannabis indica</i> to create a new masterpiece of feminized marijuana breeding! Haze Automatic gives growers easy and satisfying yields of lush flowers with a fresh, fruity flavour and an active, cheerful high.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, Haze varieties of cannabis were only grown by gardeners who could sustain their 16-24 week flowering period and cope with their soaring height, in the knowledge that their reward was usually a less-than-massive harvest of fluffy buds. It was the incredible, energetic, joyous cerebral high produced by these buds that made it all worthwhile. By reducing both the flowering time and the height of that preeminent Sativa, Haze Automatic auto-flowering feminized seeds make her sought-after effect attainable for many more cannabis cultivators, even those who need to buy seeds for growing outdoors in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Instead of waiting for a change in light cycles, this amazing Haze hybrid begins auto-flowering after about seven weeks of vegetative growth, when plants are still quite small. The flowering period is around 55-75 days and by the time Haze Automatic is ready for harvest, she is generally only 90–120cm tall.</p>
<p>Outdoors, the auto-flowering advantages of feminized Haze Automatic seeds allow plants to be harvested in September, sometimes even earlier if started at the very beginning of spring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sunny / Mediterranean</strong>Haze Automatic (Autoflowering) can be grown outside in a warm, sunny climate with a long summer.</li>
<li><strong>Average height gain</strong>Haze Automatic (Autoflowering) will have average height gain during flowering.</li>
<li><strong>Flowering 45 – 65 days</strong>Haze Automatic (Autoflowering) will have a comparatively short flowering time.</li>
<li><strong>Yield Medium Yield</strong>Haze Automatic (Autoflowering) will produce a decent amount of bud</li>
<li><strong>50% Sativa / 50% Indica </strong>The Haze Automatic (Autoflowering) is a Sativa / Indica Hybrid.</li>

<p>For extreme Sativa lovers who can’t choose between two of the best examples of this kind of cannabis – WSS presents a higher-than-high hybrid of old school Haze and recent superstar NYC Diesel, in a feminized auto-flowering seed strain. Much of the work involved in cultivating Sativa – dominant strains of this calibre is removed by these traits; there is no need to worry about extracting male plants, nor different lighting cycles during the course of the grow period and flowering time. Harvests of long, thin, typically Sativa buds sparkling with trichomes couldn’t be easier to achieve for those who choose to buy Weed Seed Shop Diesel Haze!</p>
<p>The supercharged sativa aroma and flavour of Diesel Haze maintains the sharp citrus notes of classic NYC Diesel, overlaying the subtle chamomile flavour of Haze. The effect is as powerful as is to be expected from a hybrid with this Sativa-dominant heritage: sometimes introspective, sometimes sociable, but always extremely uplifting. An especially good choice for both stimulating the appetite and enhancing the experience of eating!</p>

<p><b>Big Bud Feminized</b> is a mostly-Indica cash-cropper that definitely lives up to her name. If you want to buy cannabis seeds for a super-size harvest that’s simple to grow and maintain, Big Bud Feminized is a great choice. This notorious seed strain has been bred to produce incredibly heavy yields without compromising on quality; she’s not the fastest-flowering weed type in the Weed Seed Shop, but the extra time more than pays off. Her branches can grow so thick with bud, and the buds themselves become so, well, big that they may need to be supported to stop the branches breaking under their weight.</p>
<p>Big Bud Feminized has some Skunk heritage, improving her bulk and vigour and influencing her smooth, long-lasting high. This can be detected in her flavours also, giving a faint but definite undertone of sweetness to the classic herbal, musky taste and smell of this variation on a classic.</p>
<p>Big Bud was one of the first seed-strains to be specifically designed for commercial growing and has won the Cannabis Cup, as well as many other awards.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The heavy-yielding big sister of WSS Skunk Automatic! Big Bud Automatic feminized keeps the auto-flowering ability, short bushy Indica shape and sparkling juicy buds of WSS Skunk Automatic, while adding a sweet lemon flavour and clear, happy high to the mix, thanks to her 20% Sativa component. Indoors, the flowering phase begins when the plants are still small (normally about seven weeks after seedlings are established) and is usually completed within 60 days. Big Bud Automatic feminized seeds are easy to grow both indoors and outdoors and plants generally finish around 65-100cm tall, making this cannabis variety an ideal choice for gardeners with low ceilings or fences.</p>
<p>Big Bud Automatic gives a beautiful yield for an autoflowering strain, especially one which stays so compact. Due to their fat, oversized calyxes her delicious buds finish bigger, heavier and somewhat more open than those of WSS Skunk Automatic. Plants retain a mostly-Indica growth pattern, making these autoflowering seeds a great buy for people using Sea of Green or Screen of Green growing methods.</p>
<p>During cultivation, the smell of cannabis is quite subtle, but a gentle squeeze of the ripening tops will release a mouthwatering scent of sweet citrus, as well as leaving you with sticky fingers from their thick coating of resin glands!</p>
