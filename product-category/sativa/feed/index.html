<div class="clearfix"></div>
<p><span class="hidden-xs">Ghost Train Haze is one of the most intense strains that has ever been introduced to the marijuana universe. This strain is not for the novice Toker; after all, Ghost Train Haze was named the &#8220;Most Potent Strain on earth&#8221; by High Times magazine in 2012. This strain derives from Ghost OG &amp; Neville&#8217;s wreck, creating an insane 27% THC level. GTH is mainly sativa (80:20 sativa/indica ratio), so if you are a novice smoker or suffer from anxiety, it is best that you steer clear of this wicked strain. Heavy smoking of GTH can lead to an almost psychedelic feel that may induce paranoia. The patients who tend to opt for Ghost Train Haze are those who suffer from depression or those who are looking for an overall great time. If taken in small doses, GTH can easily send you into laughing fits and stimulate your creative mind. The aroma of this strain is a sweet blend of sour, citrus &amp; pine that is very pungent. With an abundance of trichomes and hairs, GTH basically looks as dank as it claims to be.</span></p>
<div class="s-info-desc"></div>
<p>Ghost Train Haze cannabis strain is a potent Sativa dominant hybrid bred by Rare Dankness. It took the 1st place winner of 2014 High Times Cannabis Cup US in Sativa category and 2nd place of 2013 High Times Cannabis Cup Medical Sativa category. The buds are dense, light green in color and drenched in trichomes, appearing almost white. Ghost Train Haze is very potent and was selected by High Times to represent Strongest Strains on Earth.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2></h2>
<p class="justify"><i>High Yield, Fast Finish</i>… Jack Herer is the ultimate performer, a dashing mix of heritage and knowledge. The result? A big harvest sativa that became an instant classic when it was introduced.</p>
<p class="justify">We took our time to develop this new school strain. The quest was to breed a plant that combined the greatest characteristics of the greatest plants. It took time &#8211; years &#8211; to get the strain just the way we wanted it, but the result was worth it. A femme fatale that packs a punch.</p>
<p class="justify">The strong sativa genetics of this plant mean that it can climb and those side branches will reach for the space to support its bounty of long and well formed buds. Indoor growers with limited space may look to pruning and bending methods to control the growth; more information is available from our Jacky White grow report. A prinicpal characteristic that appeals to those with indoor set ups is Jacky White’s reputation for stability, meaning consistency with results.</p>
<p class="justify">medicinla marijuana is the best friend of the outdoor gardener, hardy and low maintenance. Give it some space and moderate sunshine and it will reward you with a plant that strikes a fine pose, making it a favorite with sativa aficionados in southern regions of the world.</p>
<p class="justify">Connoisseurs in northern climes are in luck too, because this plant also thrives in more moderate climates. It may not give you the optimum yields but the skinny gene makes Jacky White mold resistant and its natural hardiness means you’ll be smoking by Halloween. The reward is tasty too &#8211; a sunshine buzz to smooth your way into that northern winter.</p>
<p class="justify">An immediate hit when it first came out, this plant’s reputation still burns strong. That’s because: for a fast growing, high yielding plant, the effects are just so damn good… An overwhelming experience served on a layer of citrus ‘haze’.</p>
<p class="justify">Smoke this and you will have a smile for the rest of the day. It is the creative’s choice with rushes of energy and inspiration making it perfect for heightened focus.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<pre class="content" data-hook="product-page-description-content">on’t let the name fool you: this is pure cannabis. Few strains compare to Green Crack’s sharp energy and focus as it induces an invigorating mental buzz that keeps you going throughout the day. With a tangy, fruity flavor redolent of mango, Green Crack is the perfect daytime medication for patients treating fatigue, stress, and depression.

Green Crack has branched into two genetic lineages, the most common of which is its sativa line descended from Skunk #1. The 75% indica variety of Green Crack is said to have come from an Afghani strain, and is marked by a tighter bud structure. Because its name perpetuates a negative image of cannabis, some people have taken to calling this strain Cush (with a ‘C’) or Green Cush instead.</pre>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Look – Tight light green nuggets with a good covering of crystals and orange hair patches here and there</p>
<p>Smell – When I first opened the container the lemon aroma hit me immediately. It isn’t like a Train wreck lemon pledge/pinesol smell, it has a more distinct clean citrus lemon fragrance to it, with earthy kush undertones.</p>
<p>Taste – I’m used to kush that has an earthiness on the exhale. Lemon Kush marijuana is the complete opposite. It had a strong earthy taste on the inhale that seemed like it was going to expand a lot, but on the exhale it was a smooth clean citrus taste.<br />
It will still make you cough, but not as bad as you think it will when you first inhale Effects – Lemon Kush weed definitely leans towards the Indica side, but it has a strong cerebral effect too. In social situations you will be relaxed yet also still alert and able to function. If you smoke it before bedtime, it will most surely help you get some Zzzzz’s. This is a very nice Indica leaning hybrid that gives you the best of both.</p>
<p>Medical Uses – Sleep aid, muscle tension, pain relief, stress, anxiety, increases appetite</p>
