				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Buy Kurupt Moonrocks online Australia</h2>
<div class="panel-body well description"><span class="hidden-xs">Moon Rock, also known as “Kurupt’s Moonrock,” is an infamous take on the classic Girl Scout Cookies strain, where the nugs are dipped in hash oil and then rolled in kief. This process supercharges the effects of Moon Rock, giving it a THC level of about 21-26% in total, making it way too strong for inexperienced users. The high hits you hard immediately after you toke, knocking you hard in the head with a cerebral rush that launches your mind into hazy bliss before leaving you completely stoned in mind and body. You’ll be utterly relaxed but totally euphoric as you slip away into a heavy couch-lock and sedation that can easily cause users to fall into a deep and peaceful sleep. Because of these effects and its insanely high THC level, Moon Rock is said to be perfect for treating insomnia, appetite loss, chronic pain, muscle spasms, and cramps. This bud has a unique flavor of earthy nutty hash that has a subtle sweetness to it from the hash oil. The aroma is surprisingly mellow, with a spicy dank overtone that’s accented by sweet earth. Moon Rock buds are round and lumpy, coated in bright kief and dripping with hash oil. MOON ROCK</span></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><img src="https://render.cannasos.com/api/strainLogo/588d7863c3bfcdc255a78755/strainLogo-moonwalker-kush.png?width=228&amp;height=228" alt="Moonwalker Kush Cannbis Strain" /></h3>
<h3>Moonwalker Kush</h3>
<p>Moonwalker Kush is a hybrid with a balanced taste and well-rounded effects, making it a great middle-of-the-road strain for cannabis novices and veterans alike. Although its effects lean toward the lazy indica end of the spectrum, it can also provide creativity and motivation under the right circumstances. This strain is a cross between 2014 <em>High Times</em> Cannabis Cup winner Triple OG (aka XXX OG) and Alien Genetics’ signature hybrid Tahoe Alien.</p>
<p>Moonwalker Kush is distinguished by medium-sized nuggets. The flowers maintain a dense and heavy indica bud structure, with tightly packed leaves and trichomes inside and out. Leaves are an earthy shade of olive green, offset by rust-colored hairs (which are actually pistils, intended to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants). The dusting of resinous trichomes makes this a sticky flower that’s difficult to break up without the use of a grinder. Moonwalker Kush’s primary aroma is dank, much like wet earth and leaves. There are also some notes of hash and black pepper. Breaking open the buds gives off a somewhat unpleasant musk that some experienced smokers might find similar to Cheese strains. When burnt, Moonwalker Kush creates a harsh, acrid smoke that may sting the sinuses and induce coughing. On the exhale, users may detect a spicy lingering aftertaste.</p>
<p>A bit of a creeper, Moonwalker Kush has effects that mount slowly, eventually hitting users with a tingle that begins in the head and moves throughout the body. There is an initial sense of disorientation &#8212; senses may feel sharper and users can perceive sights and sounds more intensely than before. Once settled in, however, smokers can enjoy a rambling free association of thoughts. Such cerebral stimulation easily lends itself to creative work or to friendly conversation. Moonwalker Kush comes with some physical effects as well: as the high progresses or as higher dosages are consumed, users will feel this strain’s OG Kush influence in a wave of relaxation. Heavy, numb limbs may provoke the feeling of melting into one’s surroundings, eventually leading to intractable couchlock.</p>
<p>These far-reaching recreational effects have medical uses as well. Moonwalker Kush can be an effective analgesic for anything from sore muscles to nerve-related pain conditions. It can relieve headaches and migraines and may even have the ability to suppress seizures and spasms. Its unique elevation of both body and mind can mitigate the symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress, helping patients to appreciate their surroundings and to live “in the moment.” This strain’s sustained sense of focus can also be beneficial to those with attention deficit disorders. In large amounts, Moonwalker Kush brings on sleep, crushing stubborn cases of insomnia. Finally, because its cerebral effects are grounded by a potent body stone, this variety comes with a lessened risk of episodic paranoia.</p>
<p>A recent crossbreed, Moonwalker Kush may be difficult to find outside of the Pacific Northwest. Packaged seeds have not yet been released for sale and clones may be similarly hard to come by. As a result, we have limited information on cultivating this strain. As with any cannabis strain, though, it can be successfully cultivated in controlled indoor conditions or in outdoor operations with semi-humid climates in the 70 degree Fahrenheit range.</p>
<p>Although it’s a balanced strain, Moonwalker Kush’s indica leanings make it more suited to nighttime than to morning or afternoon use. Its coveted equilibrium between thoughtfulness and physical stimulation make it a great choice for activities that involve both the body and brain &#8212; including, but not limited to, eating, exercise, and sex. In the right set and setting, Moonwalker Kush may even inspire smokers to teach themselves how to moonwalk.</p>

As with most Sativa strains, however, the plants grow tall and have the desired elongated buds. It grows quite well in nearly all outdoor environments. Using the Sea of Green technique, it can also be cultivated indoors. Flowering from anywhere between 50 and 70 days, the strain is ready for harvest in October when grown outside.</p>

<h3>BUY BUBBA KUSH ONLINE AUSTRALIA</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re craving a sweet smoke that leaves you relaxed, then Bubba Kush is for you. The genetic history of this strain can be traced back to the Hindu Kush mountains; however, its complete history is almost unknown due to poor documentation. Bubba Kush is 100% indica, so you can anticipate a relaxing body high that will leave you couch locked. Many patients prefer this strain due to its ability to alleviate insomnia, depression, stress, and/or ADD/ADHD. Although Bubba Kush can relieve many ailments, it is not a daytime strain; that is unless you plan on sleeping your day away. Upon smoking, you will be introduced to an earthy and sweet taste accompanied by a piney scent. Bubba Kush has vivid green and purple buds that are coated in amber hairs. The abundance of trichomes makes this strain almost as sticky as bubblegum itself.</p>
<p>Bubba Kush is a heavy indica hybrid that enjoys very wide popularity. The strain’s original L.A. breeder claims that while one parent was an OG Kush plant, the other was an unnamed Northern Lights phenotype brought back from Mardi Gras in New Orleans; this unnamed mother strain affectionately came to be known as “Bubba,” and has since been lost. Prior to 1998, Bubba Kush was only available as a clone, but it has since been replicated so that its seeds could be packaged and sold. Bubba Kush is a classic indica with a solid sedative high that leaves users relaxed but still functional. It has a typically high THC content, ranging from 15% to 22%.</p>
<p>Bubba Kush has small to medium sized buds that have the dense bud structure characteristic of indica varieties. The leaves are dark green and can sometimes show shades of purple, the result of anthocyanin pigments having been activated by cold temperatures during the growing process. This is a very resinous strain &#8212; a coating of white trichomes covers the colorful leaves, and are even visible on the inside when buds are broken open. The flowers have a vague aroma of coffee or cocoa, with some slight fruitiness beneath. When burnt, Bubba Kush smells more hashy and spicy, as might be expected of a Kush, with smoke that is fairly harsh and cough-inducing. Notably, this is one strain whose purple flowers do not result in a grape-like taste: the pigments that determine Bubba Kush’s color do not affect flavor. The taste is mostly dank, with some sweetness and a peppery kick in the exhale. This is also a particularly pungent strain &#8212; users concerned about discretion should plan accordingly.</p>
<p>Unusually for such an indica-heavy strain, Bubba Kush’s high begins with a warped, disoriented sensation in the head. This fogginess, however, gives way to a more expected body melt that intensifies as the high wears on. Although not necessarily energized, smokers can maintain mental focus and converse or perform tasks as needed. Mostly, users will experience heavy, slow-breathing relaxation and a palpable sense of physical comfort. Couchlock is uncommon, leaving users functional and alert.  Bubba Kush’s medical uses are mental as well as physical &#8212; it can provide some relief from anxiety and depression in addition to soothing chronic, deep-seated aches and pains. In large enough doses, it can serve as treatment for insomnia as well. Many users describe increased appetite as a common side effect. Well-suited to nighttime or lazy daytime use, Bubba Kush’s stimulation of both body and mind makes it great for activities that involve both &#8212; including, but not limited to, exercise and sex.</p>
<p>Bubba is a relatively easy to grow and is recommended for newcomers to cannabis cultivation.  Stocky and bushy like most other indica varieties, its plants can be grown indoors, outside, or in a greenhouse. Outdoors, the strain has the advantage of being naturally resistant to molds and other pests, but growers will have to ensure consistent sunlight and a constant daytime temperature between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Bubba Kush grows well indoors in soil, but may have a higher yield if grown in hydroponic solution. The strain flowers between 8 and 9 weeks when gropwn  indoors and is ready for harvest outdoors in early October. Though the yield for the plants of this strain is typically lower &#8212; from 32 to 35 grams (or 1 to 1.2 ounces) per square foot &#8212; the quality of the flowers is very high. The dense buds are covered in sticky trichomes, making them valuable for curing and direct sale as well as for production of hash and other concentrates. Growers should be sure to properly cure the mature buds by hanging them upside down for about a week in a room that maintains 50% humidity and a consistent temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit; and then sealing the dried buds in wide-mouthed jars in a room with a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and 60-65% humidity.</p>
<p>With a healthy fan base and immediate name recognition, Bubba Kush is a staple of the U.S. cannabis market. Its potency and solid indica genetics have crossbred into a slew of child strains like Blackberry Kush, Bubba’s Gift, and Madness. Definitely more of a nighttime strain, this aromatic smoke and relaxing high can be a great way to unwind after a long day.</p>

<p>Amnesia Gangster is a cross between Gangster OG and Amnesia. It is a sativa dominant hybrid with a 10:90 indica/sativa ratio. The strain produces a sensational 22% THC content with buds that are large and dense at the same time. The nuggets are quite colorful with light/dark greens and orange hairs seeping through the surface. Amnesia Gangster extensively borrows its taste and smell from its parents and is quite sweet, fruity, but with a distinct Kush flavor that will keep you coming back for more after each hit. Like most sativa dominant hybrids, Amnesia Gangster does not knock you out. In fact it offers a clear headed high that is actually quite calming. You will find it easier to concentrate and focus which makes it an excellent daytime strain. Moreover, it does elevate mood levels and may cause you to feel euphoric and extremely talkative. Its high offers intense cerebral effects without causing any discomfort whatsoever. Most importantly, it has been by patients to treat medical conditions like Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, mood disorders, depression, anxiety, stress and offers pain relief but to a certain extent.</p>

<div class="panel-body well description"><span class="hidden-xs">Better known as Tutankhamon, King Tut the marijuana strain pays homage to the powerful Pharaoh Tutankhamun, one of the youngest and certainly the most famous of Egypt&#8217;s early rulers. King Tut the strain is a sativa-dominant hybrid (sativa/indica ratio of 80:20) with an uncertain parentage, though it&#8217;s known to descend from the legendary sativa-dominant AK-47. THC levels are rumored to be quite high, though King Tut&#8217;s rarity makes it hard to know for sure. CBD levels, on the other hand, aren&#8217;t widely reported; that means this strain generally shouldn&#8217;t be used as the sole treatment for epilepsy or other conditions that respond to CBD. The high is cerebral and peppy, making this a good choice for daytime errands, social events, or creative endeavors. Use this strain to treat depression, chronic pain, stress, inflammation, and nausea. King Tut tastes like fresh fruit and flowers and has a sour, Skunky smell. There are few public reports of negative effects, but bloodshot eyes and dry mouth should probably be expected, along with possible paranoia. King Tut is most popular in Michigan, Arizona, and the Pacific Northwest.</span></div>

<p>Holy Grail Kush is a hybrid that is the perfect choice for beginners as it produces large resinous buds and grows well under simple conditions. In addition, Holly Grail Kush is known for its potency with THC levels exceeding 22%.Holy Grail Kush is good for day and evening time medicinal and recreational use.<br />
Type of High<br />
Induces uplifting cerebral euphoria, improves mood, increases creativity and focus, relaxes the body, overall very mild and pleasant high.<br />
Genetics<br />
Holy Grail Kush is a cross between Kosher Kush and OG #18.<br />
That power makes Holy Grail Kush a good choice for treating a wide range of conditions, including anxiety, cramps, nausea, nerve pain, and chronic bodily pain. The body high, which is both relaxing and euphoric, is a sure ticket to a good night&#8217;s sleep. But CBD levels aren&#8217;t nearly as high as THC, registering at well below 1% in some tests. That means Holy Grail Kush shouldn&#8217;t be used as front-line treatment for seizures or other health problems that respond to CBD. Likely adverse effects include cottonmouth and watery eyes, though paranoia is also widely reported. This strain has a distinct coffee flavor with notes of lemon and lime while the smell is earthy and woody with hints of pine needles. Holy Grail Kush is a cross of OG #18 and Kosher Kush and is most easily found on the legal medical markets in the American West, specifically California, Washington, Arizona, and British Columbia.</p>
